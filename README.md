# Usage
Upon rendering of the page the employees will populate. Click the "name" header to sort alphabetically. Use the search field at the top of the page to filter employees by name.

# What I learned

This was my first project to use ReactJS so it got me familiar with that. Having to add a sort and search got me used to having more states representing the same set of data. One for the original and one for the manipulated state.
